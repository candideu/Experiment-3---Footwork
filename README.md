# Based on
The "Footwork" code is largely based on ["DDR in Processing" by Jon Castro (3/24/17)](https://jon-castro.itch.io/ddr-in-processing). The music visualizer that I added to the graphics has been adapted from ["Starburst-Music-Viz" by Andre Le](https://github.com/andrele/Starburst-Music-Viz/blob/master/andreMusicViz.pde).
